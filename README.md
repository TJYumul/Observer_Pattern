## Real-time News Subscription Service

### Background

The goal of this project is to design a real-time news subscription service for a media company. The system ensures that subscribers are notified about breaking news as soon as it is published by the news agency.

### Scenario Description

The system consists of two main components:

1. **NewsAgency**: Represents the central hub for publishing news. It maintains a list of subscribers and notifies them whenever new news is available.
2. **Subscriber**: Represents users or entities that are subscribed to the news service. Subscribers receive immediate notifications when new breaking news is published by the news agency.

### Features
- **Subscription Management**: Users can subscribe to the news service, and subscribers will be promptly notified when new news is published.
- **Dynamic Subscription Updates**: Subscribers can dynamically subscribe, unsubscribe, or modify their preferences without affecting other subscribers.
- **Decoupled Communication**: Subscribers do not directly request news updates but are notified by the news agency when new information is available.

### Expected Behavior
- When the news agency publishes breaking news, all subscribed users should receive immediate updates.
- Subscribers can join or leave the service without affecting the delivery of news to other subscribers.
- The system provides flexibility for future enhancements, such as personalized subscriptions or categorization of news updates.

### Constraints
- The system is designed to scale to handle a growing number of subscribers without compromising performance.
- The implementation follows object-oriented design principles and promotes loose coupling between the news agency and subscribers.
